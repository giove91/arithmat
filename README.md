Type the following command:

```bash
sage -pip install --upgrade arithmat
```

### From source

Download the source from the git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giove91/arithmat.git
```

Change to the root directory and run:

```bash
sage -pip install --upgrade --no-index -v .
```


## Overview

Arithmat is a Sage package that implements arithmetic matroids and toric arrangements.

At its core there is the class `ArithmeticMatroidMixin`, which is intended to be used in combination with [any existing matroid class of Sage](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matroids/index.html) (e.g. `RankMatroid`, `BasisMatroid`, `LinearMatroid`) via multiple inheritance.
The most common combinations are already defined: `ArithmeticMatroid` (deriving from `RankMatroid`), `BasisArithmeticMatroid` (deriving from `BasisMatroid`), and `LinearArithmeticMatroid` (deriving from `LinearMatroid`).

An additional class `ToricArithmeticMatroid` is implemented, for arithmetic matroids constructed from a fixed given representation.


## Citing Arithmat

To cite Arithmat, you can use (some variant of) the following BibTeX code:

```latex
@Misc{arithmat,
  author = {Pagaria, Roberto and Paolini, Giovanni},
  title = {{Arithmat}: {Sage} implementation of arithmetic matroids and toric arrangements},
  year = {2019},
  url = "https://github.com/giove91/arithmat",
}
```

## Documentation

### Import

All defined classes and functions can be imported at once:

```sage
from arithmat import *
```

Alternatively, it is possible to import only specific classes and/or functions. For example:

```sage
from arithmat import ArithmeticMatroid, ToricArithmeticMatroid
```


### Available classes for arithmetic matroids

All classes for arithmetic matroids derive from `ArithmeticMatroidMixin` and from some subclass of Sage's `Matroid`.
The class `ArithmeticMatroidMixin` is not intended to be used by itself, but it is possible to subclass it in order to create new classes for arithmetic matroids.

The classes which are already provided in `arithmat` are the following.

* `ArithmeticMatroid(groundset, rank_function, multiplicity_function)`

  This is the simplest arithmetic matroid class, and derives from `ArithmeticMatroidMixin` and `RankMatroid`.

  ```sage
  E = [1,2,3,4,5]

  def rk(X):
      return min(2, len(X))

  def m(X):
      if len(X) == 2 and all(x in [3,4,5] for x in X):
          return 2
      else:
          return 1

  M = ArithmeticMatroid(E, rk, m)
  print(M)
  # Arithmetic matroid of rank 2 on 5 elements

  print(M.arithmetic_tutte_polynomial())
  # y^3 + x^2 + 2*y^2 + 3*x + 3*y + 3

  print(M.representation())
  # None (this arithmetic matroid is not representable)
  ```
* `ToricArithmeticMatroid(arrangement_matrix, torus_matrix=None, ordered_groundset=None)`

  Arithmetic matroid associated with a given toric arrangement. This class derives from `ArithmeticMatroidMixin` and `Matroid`.

  The constructor requires an integer matrix `arrangement_matrix` representing the toric arrangement. Optionally it accepts another integer matrix `torus_matrix` (whose cokernel describes the ambient torus, and defaults to `matrix(ZZ, arrangement_matrix.nrows(), 0)`) and/or an ordered copy `ordered_groundset` of the groundset (defaults to `range(matrix.ncols())`). The number of rows of `arrangement_matrix` must be equal to the numer of rows of `torus_matrix`.

  The two matrices are not guaranteed to remain unchanged: internally,`torus_matrix` is kept in Smith normal form (this also affects `arrangement_matrix`).

  ```sage
  A = matrix(ZZ, [[-1, 1, 0, 2], [3, 1, -1, -2]])
  M = ToricArithmeticMatroid(A)

  print(M)
  # Toric arithmetic matroid of rank 2 on 4 elements

  print(M.arrangement_matrix())
  # [-1  1  0  2]
  # [ 3  1 -1 -2]

  print(M.torus_matrix())
  # []

  P = M.poset_of_layers()
  print(P)
  # Finite poset containing 11 elements

  P.show(label_elements=False)
  ```
  <img src="https://github.com/giove91/arithmat/raw/master/figures/poset.png" height="240">

  ```sage
  A = matrix(ZZ, [[-1, 1, 0, 2], [3, 1, -1, -2]])
  Q = matrix(ZZ, [[5], [1]])
  N = ToricArithmeticMatroid(A, Q)

  print(N)
  # Toric arithmetic matroid of rank 1 on 4 elements

  print(N.arrangement_matrix())
  # [-16  -4   5  12]

  print(N.torus_matrix())
  # []

  ```

The classes `BasisArithmeticMatroid` and `LinearArithmeticMatroid` derive from the Sage classes `BasisMatroid` and `LinearMatroid`, respectively.
An instance of `XxxArithmeticMatroid` can be constructed with `XxxArithmeticMatroid(..., multiplicity_function=m)`, where `...` should be replaced by arguments to construct an instance of `XxxMatroid`, and `m` is the multiplicity function.
The multiplicity function needs to be passed as a keyword argument (and not as a positional argument).

* `BasisArithmeticMatroid(M=None, groundset=None, bases=None, ..., multiplicity_function)`

   ```sage
   def m(X):
       if len(X) == 2 and all(x in ['b','c','d'] for x in X):
           return 2
       else:
           return 1

   M = BasisArithmeticMatroid(groundset='abcd', bases=['ab', 'ac', 'ad', 'bc', 'bd', 'cd'], multiplicity_function=m)

   print(M)
   # Basis arithmetic matroid of rank 2 on 4 elements

   print(M.is_valid())
   # True
   ```

   It is possible to cast any arithmetic matroid to a `BasisArithmeticMatroid`:

   ```sage
   M1 = ToricArithmeticMatroid(matrix(ZZ, [[-1, 1, 0, 7], [6, 1, -1, -2]]))
   M2 = BasisArithmeticMatroid(M1)

   print(M1)
   # Toric arithmetic matroid of rank 2 on 4 elements

   print(M2)
   # Basis arithmetic matroid of rank 2 on 4 elements

   print(M2.full_multiplicity() == M1.full_multiplicity())
   # True
   ```

* `LinearArithmeticMatroid(matrix=None, groundset=None, ..., multiplicity_function)`

  ```sage
  A = matrix(GF(2), [[1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]])

  def m(X):
      return 1

  M = LinearArithmeticMatroid(A, multiplicity_function=m)

  print(M)
  # Linear arithmetic matroid of rank 3 on 5 elements

  print(M.is_valid())
  # True
  ```

Finally, `MinorArithmeticMatroid` and `DualArithmeticMatroid` are the analogs of `MinorMatroid` and `DualMatroid`.
They are used when calling `contract(X)`, `delete(X)`, `dual()` (see below).


### Available methods

All classes for arithmetic matroids must also derive from some subclass of Sage's `Matroid`.
In particular, `Matroid` methods are still available. For example:
```sage
M = ToricArithmeticMatroid(matrix(ZZ, [[1,2,3], [0,1, 1]]))
print(list(M.bases()))
# [frozenset([0, 1]), frozenset([0, 2]), frozenset([1, 2])]
```

All subclasses of `ArithmeticMatroidMixin` also (re-)implement the following methods.

* `multiplicity(X)`
  Return the multiplicity of the set `X`.

* `full_multiplicity()`
  Return the multiplicity of the groundset.

* `is_valid()`
  Check if the arithmetic matroid axioms are satisfied.
  This method overwrites `Matroid.is_valid`.

* `is_torsion_free()`
  Check if the matroid is torsion-free, i.e. the multiplicity of the empty set is equal to 1.

* `is_surjective()`
  Check if the matroid is surjective, i.e. the multiplicity of the groundset is equal to 1.

* `is_gcd()`
  Check if the matroid satisfies the gcd property, defined in [DM13, Section 3].

* `is_strong_gcd()`
  Check if the matroid satisfies the strong gcd property, defined in [PP19, Section 3].

* `is_isomorphic(other, morphism)`
  Check if the two arithmetic matroids are isomorphic.
  This method overwrites `Matroid.is_isomorphic`.

* `is_isomorphism(other, morphism)`
  Check if the given morphism of groundsets is an isomorphism of arithmetic matroids.
  It works also when comparing instances of different subclasses of `ArithmeticMatroid`.
  This method overwrites `Matroid.is_isomorphism`.

* `contract(X)`
  Contract elements.
  This method overwrites `Matroid.contract`.

* `delete(X)`
  Delete elements.
  This method overwrites `Matroid.delete`.

* `minor(contractions=None, deletions=None)`
  Contract some elements and delete some other elements.
  This method overwrites `Matroid.minor`.

* `dual()`
  Return the dual of the matroid.
  This method overwrites `Matroid.dual`.

* `arithmetic_tutte_polynomial(x=None, y=None)`
  Return the arithmetic Tutte polynomial of the matroid.

* `reduction()`
  Return the reduction of the matroid, defined in [PP19, Section 4].

* `check_representation(A, ordered_groundset=None)`
  Check if the given integer matrix `A` is a representation of the matroid.
  The optional parameter `ordered_groundset` specifies the bijection between the columns of the matrix and the groundset.

* `all_representations(ordered_groundset=None)`
  Generator of all non-equivalent essential representations of the matroid, computed using the algorithm of [PP19, Section 5].

* `num_representations()`
  Return the number of non-equivalent essential representations of the matroid.
  This calls `all_representations()`.

* `representation(ordered_groundset=None)`
  Return any essential representation of the matroid, or `None` if the matroid is not representable.

* `is_representable()`
  Check if the matroid is representable.
  This calls `representation()`.

* `is_orientable()`
  Check if the matroid is orientable as an arithmetic matroid, as defined in [Pag18].

In addition, `ToricArithmeticMatroid` has the following methods.

* `ordered_groundset()`
  Return the groundset as a list, in the same order as the columns of the matrix of the defining toric arrangement.

* `arrangement_matrix()`
  Return the matrix of the defining toric arrangement.

* `torus_matrix()`
  Return the matrix describing the ambient torus.

* `poset_of_layers()`
  Return the poset of layers of the toric arrangement, computed using Lenz's algorithm [Len17a].

* `arithmetic_independence_poset()`
  Return the arithmetic independence poset of the toric arrangement, defined in [Len17b, Definition 5], [Mar18, Definitions 2.1 and 2.2], [DD18, Section 7].
  Notice that it is not the same as the independence poset of the underlying matroid.

* `decomposition()`
  Return the partition of the groundset corresponding to the decomposition of the matroid as a direct sum of indecomposable matroids.
  Uses the algorithm of [PP19, Section 7].

* `is_decomposable()`
  Check if the matroid is decomposable.

* `is_indecomposable()`
  Check if the matroid is not decomposable.

* `is_equivalent(other, morphism=None)`
  Check if the two ToricArithmeticMatroids are equivalent (i.e. the defining representations are equivalent; see [PP19, Section 2]).
  If the morphism is not given, the two ordered groundsets are assumed to be the same.

The following function is available outside of arithmetic matroid classes.

* `signed_hermite_normal_form(A)`
  Return the signed Hermite normal form of the integer matrix `A`, defined in [PP19, Section 6].
  ```sage
  from arithmat import signed_hermite_normal_form

  print(signed_hermite_normal_form(matrix([[3, 2, 1], [-1, 1, 3]])))
  # [  1   1  -3]
  # [  0   5 -10]
  ```
